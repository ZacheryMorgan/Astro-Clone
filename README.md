## Built Using
- Astro
- 100% TailwindCSS

## 100 in Lighthouse

### Bootcamp project to learn Astro and practice Tailwind, so I went overboard and used [Astro's site](https://Astro.build) as a reference to clone, while creating some of my own designs.

### Login and Signup do not work, I did not push my NodeJS to handle the forms with this Github. 
### Mobile Nav Menu also doesn't work, JavaScript was not the point of this exercise for me.
